About Project:
This project analyzes the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by approximately 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09). Based on this analysis, I develop a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year on the basis of it's previious purchases.

This project uses hefty amount of data analysis and data visualisation. It also uses the concept of Dimensionality reduction, Clustering, Multiclass Classification and much more!!
